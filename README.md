# MLCapstone
Capstone project for Intro to ML

This repository contains the full implementation of my capstone project for Intro to Machine Learning. The goal of the project is to predict housing sale prices using classical regression models and reproduce two machine-learning approaches from recent research papers. All models are trained and evaluated on the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle.
